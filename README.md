# PORTFOLIO SITE

This is my portfolio site, there are many like it, but this is mine.

### index.html

The home page of the website. This will contain basic information about myself. I expect this to grow as the course progresses, so for now, it has a lot of stuff unrelated to my career goals and more related more to my life and hobbies.

### portfolio.html

This will contain the list of projects I am most proud of. I left a spot for a screenshot, Git repo, site URL, and a brief description.

### contact.html

The contact page has my GitHub repo, email address, phone number, and my LinkedIn profile. I also have the logos of technologies I am familiar with since the page looked a tad empty.



This site was created using HTML5 and BootStrap 4. This made it incredibly easy to create responsive webpages. The ready-made components available on the BootStrap site made it even easier.
